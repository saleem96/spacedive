'WELCOME_EMAIL_CONTENT_ENG'=>"Welcome to Spacedive! We are happy to have you on board <br>  <br>
   You are now ready to focus on what you do best and get rid of the administration.  Cool! <br>  <br>
   To ensure that you get the best possible start, here is a brief introduction onhow to use our platform and set your business on autopilot:<br><br>
 <h4 style='text-align:center;'> THAT'S HOW IT WORKS </h4> <br>  <br>
1. <b>Create gig </b>
<br><br>
You start by creating a gig, ie. the task you have to go out and do.<br>
When you create your gig, you state which job you need to go out and do, who your client is, the agreed amount you need to invoice, the duration of the job and the type of work.<br><br>
Spacedive automatically makes sure to find the cheapest insurance for your task, 
<br>
which means that you are always covered by our business liability and business accident insurance when you are out on a gig. <br><br>
Once you have created your gig, we’ll notify your client for approval and when the gig is confirmed Spacedive hires you for the job - and of course we take care of all the administrative, so you just have to focus on what you do best!
<br><br>
2. <b>Send invoice </b>
<br><br>
Once you have completed a gig, you will need to bill your assignment.<br><br>
Under ' + New invoice' you can see your gigs and choose which gig to invoice. By selecting your gig, the entire invoice section opens, where all information is retrieved automatically. 
<br><br>
Remember to state the payment date, ie. when your client must pay the amount at the latest. (If in doubt you can always contact us) 
<br><br>
In the invoice, you can easily make changes to the amount if it has changed since you created the gig - it can e.g. be overtime,
 etc. We have created a note field where you can let us know if you are making changes and why. It is also in the invoice part you can choose whether you want to transfer money from the invoiced amount to your FerieKonto (Holiday pay), it is entirely up to you - We play by your rules! 
<br><br>
3.<b> Get paid </b>
<br><br>
Once you have created the invoice from your gig, Spacedive will send it to your client and once we have received the amount, we will make payout your salary! Easy right? 
<br><br>
You will of course receive a payslip sent to your e-Boks, exactly as you know it. 
<br><br>
Spacedive takes care of all the boring stuff and we make sure you are always insured – You just need to sit back and focus on what you do best! 
<br><br>
Made with ♥️
<br>
